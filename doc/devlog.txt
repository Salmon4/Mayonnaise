Tested dropdown menu for selecting sports team. Used Javascript code found online.

Got data from NHL API for each team the user adds to preferences. Made cards to display the data for each team.
Made functions in sportsfunctions to retrieve data for a team's most recent score from the API, it displays properly on the card.

Started foreign currency exchange API. Tested retrieving and displaying base currency but front end needs more work. Added other
sports API hyperlink to README.md.

chenB -- 2019-11-24 14:00
Separated each API so they load when needed not all at the same time. Added topbar to basics and moved weather to under its tab.

Team -- 2019-11-20
Actions we will take to improve based on the assigned reading:
1. We should share code with our teammates to review/debug. You shouldn't be defensive about your errors as debugging helps improve
the project. Be like Bill Gates.
2. Understand formal and informal structures and factors in our programming environment.
