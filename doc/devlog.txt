Began writing sqlite database functions for creating and deleting tables.

pehlivanianL -- 2019-11-20 20:51
Created base.html and added Foundation stylesheet. Spent a long time debugging and finding the right stylesheet. Made
homepage.html extend base.html.

pehlivanianL -- 2019-11-20 22:05
Copied over login and register code to html and app files. Tested and made fixes. Added working logout button to home.html and app.

wanA -- 2019-11-21 14:48
Started on metaweather API and added to app.py. I fixed an error on the homepage.html and added variables for the weather.

pehlivanianL -- 2019-11-21 14:50
Began sports page. Tried to retrieve data from MySportsFeeds API but nothing was displayed. Switched to NHL API.

pehlivanianL -- 2019-11-21 22:06
Fetched team names from NHL API for user to choose team to add to prefs. Dropdown still doesn't work correctly even after debugging.

pehlivanianL -- 2019-11-22 14:55
Tested dropdown menu for selecting sports team. Used Javascript code found online.

wanA -- 2019-11-22 14:55
Added weather API and works for New York. I put lowest, highest, and regular temp with a picture of the temperature. Hopefully I can do a whole week and put it on the website.

chenB -- 2019-11-22 23:32
Fixed issues with tabs not correctly displaying by using url_for to keep track of current tab. Default tab displayed will be the
first tab. Updated README.md with some API hyperlinks but haven't found them all yet.

pehlivanianL -- 2019-11-23 10:09
Finally figured out how to post data from dropdown menu. Displays user's team selections on sports page.
Added functions to sportsfunctions which returns arrays of teams and data.

pehlivanianL -- 2019-11-23 21:32
Got data from NHL API for each team the user adds to preferences. Made cards to display the data for each team.
Made functions in sportsfunctions to retrieve data for a team's most recent score from the API, it displays properly on the card.

chenB -- 2019-11-23 23:44
Started foreign currency exchange API. Tested retrieving and displaying base currency but front end needs more work. Added other
sports API hyperlink to README.md.

wanA --2019-11-23 23:45
Finished adding weeks for the weather. Now it shows 5 days in advance from the orginal. Also, I tried to make it look good by using grids.
chenB -- 2019-11-24 14:00
Separated each API so they load when needed not all at the same time. Added topbar to basics and moved weather to under its tab.

chowdhuryB -- 2019-11-24 19:42
Started work on the news api, began trying to prevent multiple calls to the api and storing news information in the database

chenB -- 2019-11-24 21:17
Updated sitemap to include account tab for personalizing data.

chenB -- 2019-11-24 20:09
Changed formatting of how apis get displayed. Added an account tab and html. It will prompt you to login or create an account if
you want to. It will soon be able to manage overall personalizations. Updated sitemap.

pehlivanianL -- 2019-11-25 14:55
Added sports.html code to tab 3 of home.html, moved code from /sports to /home.
Started adding code to display scorecards in a grid.

pehlivanianL -- 2019-11-26 14:50
Did research to find free NBA API, made account.
Tested API using http.client requests.

pehlivanianL -- 2019-11-27 14:29
Moved code from home.html tab back into separate sports.html page, moved app.py code into /sports.

chenB -- 2019-11-27 14:39
Got the base money in currency exchange tab to display along with all of the other foreign currency rates per 1 base dollar.

pehlivanianL -- 2019-11-27 14:55
Formatted scorecards to show which team won/lost and update color of scores and teams to be red or green.

chenB -- 2019-11-27 22:28
Place each currency exchange rates into cards in a 4 column grid format with base currency at the top.

pehlivanianL -- 2019-11-28 23:40
Added function to get next game info for each team. Added code to sports.html to print this info on each team's card.
Did more research on using NBA API (the documentation is short/kind of unhelpful)

pehlivanianL -- 2019-11-29 10:19
Added function to get 3 scores from today's schedule. Created nhl_today table, and function resets the table each day.
Added code to print today's score (formatted) in sports.html in cards, regardless of whether the user is logged in.

chenB -- 2019-11-30 19:03
Added function that allows the user to input how much of the base currency they want to convert. Displayed foreign currency will change
accordingly and is in floats to account for cents. Default is 1.

chenB -- 2019-12-1 16:29
Able to change the base currency when converting money. It is always USD by default when account is created but afterwards both amount
and currency type is remembered when changed.

Team -- 2019-11-20
Actions we will take to improve based on the assigned reading:
1. We should share code with our teammates to review/debug. You shouldn't be defensive about your errors as debugging helps improve
the project. Be like Bill Gates.
2. Understand formal and informal structures and factors in our programming environment.

"HOME STRETCH PLAN"
1. Finish displaying all necessary API data (stock/foreign currency exchange).
2. Finish personalizing any data with user's preference.
3. Beautify the website.
